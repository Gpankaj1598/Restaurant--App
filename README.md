# Restaurant--App
Developing a Restaurant App in React.js required a component-based architecture, efficient state management, and API integration to ensure a smooth user experience. The goal was to create a responsive and interactive platform where users could browse the menu, place orders, and make reservations seamlessly.

Key Concepts & Highlights

1.Component-Based Architecture.
The app was structured into reusable components like Navbar, MenuItem, Cart, ReservationForm, and Footer.
This modular approach improved code reusability and maintainability.

2. State Management with Hooks & Context API/Redux
useState was used for managing local states, such as form inputs and toggle states.
useEffect handled API calls and side effects, like fetching menu data from a backend.
Context API (or Redux) was implemented to manage global states, such as cart data and user authentication, ensuring smooth data flow across components.
